# j3w1.github.io agent instructions

Inspect the worktree and [README](README.md) before editing. Preserve unrelated work and the
dependency-free GitHub Pages architecture, Git-managed content, deterministic generated artifacts,
and separate authenticated `j3w1ctl-auth` trust boundary. Do not expose credentials, private staged
media, personal data, or provider configuration. Metadata work does not authorize site publication,
backend deployment, domain changes, or production mutation.

## CE Metadata Reconciler integration

This repository is managed by the CE Metadata Reconciler. Nothing is installed here: the GitHub
App already reads this repository, and this section is the cooperation contract an agent working
in it needs to know.

**Protected CE label prefixes:** ce-systems, cross-repo, historical-evidence, type:, area:, concern:. Labels outside them are never touched.
Within them the reconciler is authoritative: a reviewed rule states an object's whole managed
label set, so a CE label added by hand and absent from that rule is drift, and the next sweep
removes it.

**Project membership** is written by the owner-authenticated Project bridge, over a reviewed
enumerated set of objects. The native *Item added to project* workflow is retired, so there is
exactly one writer. **Project Status** is *not* the reconciler's: GitHub's own native Project
workflows own it, and building a competing writer is ruled out rather than pending. The full
per-surface answer is
[`policy/surface-dispositions.yaml`](https://github.com/j3w1/ce-metadata-reconciler/blob/main/policy/surface-dispositions.yaml).

**You do not need to run the classifier, and it is no longer only evidence.** Every sweep
classifies uncovered objects automatically, and since [ADR 0038](https://github.com/j3w1/ce-metadata-reconciler/blob/main/docs/adr/0038-reviewed-classification-rules-as-label-authority.md)
a complete, canonical, unambiguous classification derived from reviewed rules *is* label
authority in all six managed repositories: it becomes the object's exact managed label set where
no explicit reviewed rule already covers it. An earlier version of this section said
classification is evidence and never authority. That was true when it was written and is false
now, which is the single most important correction here.

What has not changed is the half that fails closed. An object whose evidence does not decide a
single `type:` and a single `area:` sits at `NEEDS_REVIEW` writing nothing until somebody reviews
it. An incomplete changed-file list is a narrower case than it sounds: it fails a *universal* fact
closed - "every path here is documentation" cannot be established from a truncated list - but an
*existential* one can still hold, so a truncated list does not by itself withhold.

Since [ADR 0039](https://github.com/j3w1/ce-metadata-reconciler/blob/main/docs/adr/0039-semantic-pr-evidence.md)
a pull request is classified from the files it changed **as well as** its title, and those are two
evidence classes with a precedence between them rather than one replacing the other: where they
disagree in an exclusive namespace structure wins and the title rule's whole contribution is set
aside, and where they agree they merge - so a title rule can still supply an `area:` that structure
is silent about, which is how the cooperation-contract pull requests took `area:metadata`. Within a
class there is no principled winner, so two conflicting title rules and two conflicting structural
rules both fail closed. A `CE-####` prefix implies neither a type nor an area. A reviewed answer
becomes a reusable rule rather than a one-off, so the next object of that shape is decided too. See
[How an Object Becomes Governed](https://github.com/j3w1/ce-metadata-reconciler/blob/main/docs/operator-handbook/How-an-Object-Becomes-Governed.md).

An earlier version of this section said a pull request is classified from its changed files
*rather than* its title, and that incomplete evidence withholds. Independent review of
`casaelida.com#118` found both overstated, against ADR 0039 and against
`test_existential_structure_still_decides_on_a_truncated_list`. The wording above is the correction.

The reconciler owns only metadata surfaces explicitly activated by protected policy and rollout
authority. Do not create competing label, dashboard, or Project automation. Its output never
grants source, task, review, merge, release, deployment, or production authority.

**This repository's own profile is reviewed policy, not a claim made here.** Its role is
`personal-site-adjacent`, its membership writer is `OWNER_AUTHENTICATED_BRIDGE`, and the label prefixes above are
what protected policy currently allows it. Read them from
[`policy/repositories.yaml`](https://github.com/j3w1/ce-metadata-reconciler/blob/main/policy/repositories.yaml)
rather than from this file, and verify the current surface grant and proven writer before any
operation - a grant names exact repositories and, at a canary ring, exact objects, so being in
the allowlist is not the same as being covered by a live grant.

Report `HOLD`, `CONFLICT`, `NEEDS_REVIEW`, or policy/installation drift to
[`ce-metadata-reconciler#7`](https://github.com/j3w1/ce-metadata-reconciler/issues/7), the
operational dashboard. Earlier versions of this contract pointed at `#2`, which is now closed.
