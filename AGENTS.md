# j3w1.github.io agent instructions

Inspect the worktree and [README](README.md) before editing. Preserve unrelated work and the
dependency-free GitHub Pages architecture, Git-managed content, deterministic generated artifacts,
and separate authenticated `j3w1ctl-auth` trust boundary. Do not expose credentials, private staged
media, personal data, or provider configuration. Metadata work does not authorize site publication,
backend deployment, domain changes, or production mutation.

## CE Metadata Reconciler integration

This active-managed repository uses profile `personal-site-adjacent`; protected CE label prefixes
are `ce-systems`, `cross-repo`, `historical-evidence`, `type:`, `area:`, and `concern:`. Project
membership is currently `MANUAL_OWNER`; the protected post-cutover target is
`OWNER_AUTHENTICATED_BRIDGE`. Follow the
[canonical manual](https://github.com/j3w1/casaelida.com/tree/main/docs/operations/metadata-reconciler)
and [machine policy](https://github.com/j3w1/ce-metadata-reconciler/tree/main/policy); report
`HOLD`, `CONFLICT`, `NEEDS_REVIEW`, or policy/installation drift to
[`ce-metadata-reconciler#2`](https://github.com/j3w1/ce-metadata-reconciler/issues/2).

CE Metadata Reconciler owns only metadata surfaces explicitly activated by protected policy and
rollout authority. Do not create competing label, dashboard, or Project automation. Its output
never grants source, task, review, merge, publication, release, deployment, or production authority.
